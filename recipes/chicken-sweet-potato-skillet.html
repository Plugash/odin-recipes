        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>A savory combination of chicken, sweet potato, and spinach is seasoned with sage, sweetened with pear, 
            given a splash of whiskey for a kick, and topped with toasted hazelnuts. It makes a lovely fall supper!</p>
    
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 skinless, boneless chicken breast half, cut into cubes</li>
            <li>1 large sweet potato, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Irish whiskey</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh sage</li>
            <li>1 pear - peeled, cored, and cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
            <li>2 cups baby spinach</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped toasted hazelnuts</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir chicken in the hot oil until browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove chicken with a slotted spoon and place on a plate.</li>
            <li>Cook and stir sweet potato in the same skillet over medium heat until slightly browned, 5 to 10 minutes; return chicken to the skillet. Add whiskey, sage, pear, and water; stir well. Partially cover skillet, lower heat to medium-low, and cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and sweet potato is tender, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove lid and sprinkle spinach over the chicken-sweet potato mixture; cook, stirring occasionally, until spinach is wilted, about 5 minutes. Stir in hazelnuts; season with salt and black pepper.</li>
        </ol>
